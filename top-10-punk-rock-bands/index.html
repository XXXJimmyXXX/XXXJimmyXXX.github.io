<h2>10. Black Flag</h2>
<img class="standard-height" src="http://static.spin.com/files/131127-black-flag-ron-reyes-quits_0.jpg" alt="Black Flag">
<p>
Black Flag was part of the first wave of punk rock on the American west coast. 
Like many other punk rock bands, many of their songs were considered offensive due to their extreme non-conformist and anti-authority views.
They also explored many other politically questionable topics such as poverty, isolation, paranoia, and even mental illness.
Their songs were fast, loud, intense, and helped set the standard for what hardcore punk should sound like.
</p>

<li> 
<h2>9. Misfits</h2>
<img class="standard-height" src="http://www.oztix.com.au/Portals/10/The%20misfits.gif" alt="Misfits">
<p>
Although the misfits were not the first hardcore punk band, they are credited with originating a subgenre of punk rock known as horror punk that features shocking, dark, and even violent imagery.
Despite lineup changes, and legal battles the misfits still maintain their cult status today.

<h2>8. Bad Brains</h2>

<p>
Starting out as a jazz fusion group called Mind Power, Bad Brains soon found a home as a hardcore punk band, but also incorporated reggae, funk, soul, hip-hop, and heavy metal into their music.
 Although they don't like the label, they definitely made a lasting impact on the punk rock genre.

<p>
My Chemical Romance (often abbreviated MCR), was a major part of new millennium punk rock wave.
Despite punk's disappearance in the late 80s/early 90s they came back in the late 90s/early 2000s.
My Chemical Romance was one of the first "post hardcore"/"modern punk" bands and their success helped jumpstart the explosion of new punk rock and emo bands of the new millennium.

<h2>6. Dead Kennedys</h2>
<img class="standard-height" src="http://punkygibbon.co.uk/images/d/deadkennedys/photo_lineup2.jpg" alt="Dead Kennedys">
<p>
The Dead Kennedys were one of the first popular punk rock bands. 
Their extreme, democratic, political views were obvious in their lyrics and offended many.
They even had an obscenity trial over the artwork of their album Frankenchrist.
Despite this their music is still widely known and successful.

<h2>5. Iggy Pop and the Stooges</h2>
<img class="standard-height" src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/BJIqnXTqg8I/0.jpg" alt="The Stooges">
<p>

They are even members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

<p>
After punk rock's brief disappearance, Green Day was one of the first "modern punk rock" bands.
They are one of the main reasons why punk has come back, (and is now as strong as ever).
Green Day is now one of the most widely successful bands ever and have been inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and have sold over 75 million records worldwide, including their album American Idiot, which has since been turned into a musical.

<p>
The Sex Pistols are credited with starting the punk rock movement of the U.K. 
Their music attacked social conformity (and also got them baned from some radio stations in the process).

<h2>1. The Ramones</h2>
<img class="standard-height" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bb/Ramones_-_Ramones_cover.jpg" alt="The Ramones">
<p>
The Ramones are considered by many to be the first true punk rock band. 
All of the members were given the surname "Ramone" in order to appear like a group of brothers or a gang.
They were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and spin magazine named them the second greatest band of all time (after the Beatles).
